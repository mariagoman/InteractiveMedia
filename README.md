!!!! READ HERE ABOUT THE SECOND ASSIGNMENT !!!!

I knew I forgot to do one thing, but once I realized it it was too late- I forgot to change the title...

It was supposed to be called, "HOW WE MET"

I tried to make an interactive story loosely inspired by how I met my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I often ponder at how things would have turned out differently had we both not decided to go to church one fateful Thursday evening. For us, it was literally a small, split second decision that changed the course of our whole history. He contemplated not going to church that evening because it was snowing, and I contemplated not going to church because I couldn't fit in with the people there. I was considering not ever going back to that particular church, but then my dad said, "Just give it one more try?" And I'm so glad I listened.

I wanted the story to highlight how even small decisions can impact our entire future.

I found Twine very easy to use, and I really enjoyed using it. It's very simple and straight to the point. The only problems I faced was just the story narrative itself. I thought the story was going to be simple, but I guess it's really easy to overcomplicate things, and I think that's what I did here. Our reading material for last week told us that an effective nonlinear narrative is straight to the point. I noticed myself adding more branches than neccessary, and it was starting to get more complicated and harder to organize the story. However, I finally pulled through and finished everything. 

Next time, I will definetely try to make the narrative more simple.
